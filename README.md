Transforming Agriculture Through Innovation
Project Title: AgriSmart – Transforming Agriculture Through Innovation
1. Project Overview
AgriSmart is a full-stack MERN application designed to digitize and modernize agricultural practices by providing smallholder farmers with real-time access to farming advice, market prices, weather updates, and farm data analytics. The platform promotes innovation, efficiency, and data-driven decision-making in agriculture.

Key Features:
•	User Management: Registration, login, role-based access (farmer, agronomist, admin)
•	Crop Advisory Service: AI/ML API integration for smart farming tips
•	Market Linkage: CRUD APIs for listing and viewing market produce and prices
•	Weather Forecast: Integrate with external weather APIs
•	Farm Monitoring: Store and retrieve data on farm activities
•	Notifications: SMS/email alerts for tips, weather, and market updates
Backend Structure:
•	Models: User, Farm, Crop, Market, Advisory, Alert
•	RESTful API with JWT-based authentication
•	Input validation with Joi or express-validator
•	Centralized error handling

B. Frontend Development (React.js)
Key Features:
•	Dashboard: Personalized insights, alerts, and quick access to key features
•	Farm Data Entry: Forms for logging planting, irrigation, pesticide usage, etc.
•	Market Section: View current crop prices, demand trends
•	Advisory Portal: View AI-generated tips and agronomist recommendations
•	Weather Updates: Weekly forecasts and real-time updates
•	Responsive UI: Mobile-first design
Frontend Stack:
•	React (Functional Components & Hooks)
•	Redux Toolkit or Context API for state management
•	Axios for API calls
•	Tailwind CSS or Material UI for design

C. Testing Strategy
Backend:
•	Unit Tests: Jest + Supertest (e.g., user registration, crop record creation)
•	Integration Tests: Ensure API endpoints work as expected
Frontend:
•	Component Testing: React Testing Library
•	E2E Testing: Cypress or Playwright for simulating user workflows

D. Deployment
Infrastructure:
•	Backend: Hosted on Render
•	Frontend: Deployed via Vercel 
•	Database: MongoDB Atlas
CI/CD:
•	GitHub Actions for automated testing & deployment

# MERN Stack Capstone Project

This assignment focuses on designing, developing, and deploying a comprehensive full-stack MERN application that showcases all the skills you've learned throughout the course.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Plan and design a full-stack MERN application
2. Develop a robust backend with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js
3. Create an interactive frontend with React.js
4. Implement testing across the entire application
5. Deploy the application to production

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment
2. Clone the repository to your local machine
3. Follow the instructions in the `Week8-Assignment.md` file
4. Plan, develop, and deploy your capstone project

## Files Included
